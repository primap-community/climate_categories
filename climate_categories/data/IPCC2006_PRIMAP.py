These categories utilise different technologies such as heat exchangers, expansion devices, pipings and compressors. The six application domains are domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, industrial processes, transport refrigeration, stationary air conditioning, mobile air- conditioning systems. For all these applications, various HFCs are selectively replacing CFCs and HCFCs.  For example, in developed countries, HFC-134a has replaced CFC-12 in domestic refrigeration and mobile air conditioning systems, and blends of HFCs such as R-407C (HFC-32/HFC-125/HFC-134a) and R-410A (HFC-32/HFC- 125) are replacing HCFC-22 mainly in stationary air conditioning.  Other, non HFC substances are used to replace CFCs and HCFCs such as iso-butane in domestic refrigeration or ammonia in industrial refrigeration. HFC- 152a is also being considered for mobile air conditioning in several regions.",

The processes and applications for which these various HFCs are being used include insulation boards and panels, pipe sections, sprayed systems and one- component gap filling foams. For open-cell foams, such as integral skin products for automotive steering wheels and facias, emissions of HFCs used as blowing agents are likely to occur during the manufacturing process. In closed- cell foam, emissions not only occur during the manufacturing phase, but usually extend into the in-use phase and often the majority of emission occurs at the end- of-life (de-commissioning losses).

PFCs played an early role in halon 1301 replacement but current use is limited to replenishment of previously installed systems. HFCs in portable equipment, typically replacing halon 1211, are available but have achieved very limited market acceptance due primarily to their high cost.
