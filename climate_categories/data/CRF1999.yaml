    title: Fuel Combustion Activities
    comment: Total emissions of all greenhouse gases from all fuel combustion activities
      as described further below. CO2 emissions from combustion of biomass fuels are
      not included in totals for the energy sector. They may not be net emissions
      if the biomass is sustainably produced. If biomass is harvested at an unsustainable
      rate (that is, faster than annual regrowth), net CO2 emissions will appear as
      a loss of biomass stocks in the Land-Use Change and Forestry module. Other greenhouse
      gases from biomass fuel combustion are considered net emissions and are reported
      under Energy. (Sum of I A 1 to I A 5). Incineration of waste for waste-to-energy
      facilities should be reported here and not under Section 6C. Emissions based
      upon fuel for use on ships or aircraft engaged in international transport (1
      A 3 a i and 1 A 3 d i) should, as far as possible, not be included in national
      totals but reported separately.

      as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may
      be in public or private ownership. Emissions from own on-site use of fuel should
      be included. Emissions from autoproducers (undertakings which generate electricity/heat
      wholly or partly for their own use, as an activity which supports their primary
      activity) should be assigned to the sector where they were generated and not
      under 1 A 1 a. Autoproducers may be in public or private ownership.

    comment: Emissions from combustion of fuels in industry including combustion for

      be assigned to the sector where they were generated and an attempt made to separately
      identify the emissions associated with autogeneration from those associated
      with process heat. Emissions from fuel combustion in coke ovens within the iron
      and steel industry should be reported under 1 A 1 c and not within manufacturing
      industry. Emissions from the industry sector should be specified by subsectors
      that correspond to the International Standard Industrial Classification of All
      Economic Activities, 3rd Edition (ISIC)  [International Standard Industrial
      Classification of all Economic Activities, Series M No. 4, Rev. 3, United Nations,
      New York, 1990]. Energy used for transport by industry should not be reported
      here but under Transport (1 A 3 below). Emissions arising from off-road and
      other mobile machinery in industry should, if possible, be broken out as a separate
      subcategory. For each country, the emissions from the largest fuel-consuming
      industrial categories (ISIC) should be reported, as well as those from significant
      emitters of pollutants. A suggested list of categories is outlined below.

      landing and take-off (LTO) cycle emissions are often considered as domestic
      emissions. For the purpose of greenhouse gas emissions inventories, fuel used
      during landing and take-off for an international flight stage is considered
      to be part of International Bunkers fuel use.)

      processing, transmission, storage and use of fuels, and include emissions from
      combustion only where it does not support a productive activity (e.g., flaring
      of natural gases at oil and gas production facilities). Evaporative emissions
      from vehicles are included under Road Transport as Subsection 1 A 3 b v. Sum

    title: Industrial Processes
    comment: Emissions within this sector comprise by-product or fugitive emissions
      of greenhouse gases from industrial processes. Emissions from fuel combustion
      in industry should be reported under Energy. In instances where industrial process
      emissions result jointly from chemical processes and fuel combustion it may
      be difficult to assign the emission(s) to either sector. Where the main purpose
      of the fuel combustion is to use the heat released, the resulting emissions
      should be assigned to the Energy sector. Emissions should, wherever possible,
      be reported according to the ISIC Group or Class within which they occur. Certain
      methods in Chapter and Module 2, however, infer final GHG emissions from supply
      of the GHG, equipment containing it (for example, air conditioning equipment)
      or a stock material with which emissions are linked (for example, limestone).
      In these cases, assignment of emissions to ISIC activities may be difficult
      or incomplete.

    comment: This category covers mainly NMVOC emissions resulting from the use of
      solvents and other products containing volatile compounds. When the solvents
      and other products are, or are produced from, petroleum products, the carbon
      in the NMVOC emissions will be included in the CO2 inventory if the Reference
      Approach for CO2 emissions from energy is used. See note on double counting
      in “Overview of the IPCC Guidelines”. Emissions from the consumption of halocarbons
      and sulphur hexafluoride should be reported in the Industrial Processes Chapter
      under 2 F. All other non-energy emissions not included under Industrial Processes
      are reported here.

      under low oxygen or anaerobic conditions. These conditions often occur when
      large numbers of animals are managed in a confined area (e.g. dairy farms, beef
      feedlots, and swine and poultry farms), where manure is typically stored in
      large piles or disposed of in lagoons and other types of manure management systems.

    title: Rice Cultivation
    comment: The anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields
      produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere by ebullition (bubbling up)
      through the water column, diffusion across the water/air interface, and transport
      through the rice plants. It is suggested that these CH4 emissions be based on
      lowland rice ecosystems without organic amendments relating to water regime,
      where lowland refers to fields flooded for a significant period of time. Correction
      factors for soils with organic amendments from the use of should be applied
      as necessary. Any N2O emissions nitrogen-based fertilisers in rice cultivation
      should be reported under 4 D Agricultural Soils.

    comment: Emissions and removals of CH4 and N2O from agricultural soil/land and
      NMVOCs from crops. These are influenced by irrigation practices, climatic variables,
      soil temperature and humidity. Any N2O emissions from the use of nitrogen-based
      fertilisers in rice cultivation should be reported here. N2O emissions may be
      related to the use of both organic and inorganic fertilisers, biological Nitrogen
      fixation, and return of crop residues to the field or to animal production.
      Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of compost and human
      waste as fertilisers should also be recorded in this category. Emissions of
      N2O from sewage are to be reported under Waste from animal waste (6 B) and N2O
      emissions management systems other than grazing under manure management (4 B).
      Emissions of N2O from manure used for fuel are reported under the Energy Module
      (1 A).

    comment: Emissions of CH4, CO, N2O, and NOx from the burning of savannas*. Savannas
      are burned to control the growth of vegetation, remove pests and weeds, promote
      the nutrient cycle and to encourage the growth of new grass for animal grazing.
      CO2 from savanna burning is noted for information but is not included in the
      inventory total since it is assumed that an equivalent amount of CO2 is removed
      by regrowing vegetation in the following year. *Savannas are tropical and subtropical
      formations with continuous grass cover, occasionally interrupted by trees and
      shrubs, which exist in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Australia.

      straw, maize stalks, etc.); green crop residues (e.g. groundnut straw, soybean
      tops, etc.). The burning of agricultural waste for energy is excluded here but
      included under fuel combustion activities in Section 1 A. CO2 from vegetal or
      biomass burning is noted for information but is not included in the inventory
      total, since it is assumed that a roughly equivalent amount of CO2 is removed
      by regrowth of the next crop.
