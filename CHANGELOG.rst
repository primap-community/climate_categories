------------------
* Re-release again.

0.8.4 (2023-05-23)
------------------
* Re-release to make sure py.typed is included in built package.

0.8.3 (2023-05-23)
------------------
* add py.typed file to announce this library is using type hints.

0.8.2 (2023-05-15)
------------------
* Remove pygments-csv-lexer dependency for docs building.
* Add function to find leaf children of a category, useful for re-calculating top-level

------------------
* Add updated CRF2013 terminologies for 2021, 2022, and 2023 submission rounds
* The unfccc DI API recently returns unspecified measure IDs.
  data_generation/CRFDI_class.py was fixed to ignore them.
* Add CRF2013 terminology for data submitted by AnnexI countries to the UNFCCC
* Drop support for Python 3.7 and 3.8, add support for Python 3.11

0.7.1 (2021-11-25)
------------------
* Change conversion metadata format to use comment chars and a YAML header.

0.7.0 (2021-11-25)
------------------
* Use Python files instead of pickle objects for caching

0.6.3 (2021-11-05)
------------------
* Export Category and HierarchicalCategory types.
* Add ConversionRule.is_restricted attribute to easily check if a rule is restricted to
  specific auxiliary categories.

0.6.2 (2021-11-05)

0.6.1 (2021-11-04)
------------------
* Add emissions categorization from the `Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP) <https://www.rcmip.org/>`_. Thanks to Robert Gieseke for the contribution and Zeb Nicholls for input.

------------------
* Automate changelog generation from snippets - avoids resolving merge conflicts
  manually
* Automate github releases.
* Add category "0" (National total) to IPCC1996 and IPCC2006 categorizations. While it
  is not in the official specification, it is widely used and adding it also enables
  automatically assigning a level to all other categories.
* Add categorization CRF1999 used within in the common reporting framework data.
* Refactor rendering of large categorizations using ``show_as_tree()``, adding more
  clarity to alternative child sets. Add usage documentation for ``show_as_tree()``.
  Thanks to Robert Gieseke for feedback.
* Fixes for IPCC2006 categorization (and IPCC2006_PRIMAP):

  - proper title for category 3.B.3.a "Grassland Remaining Grassland"
  - correct corresponding 1996 category for category 1.A.4.c.ii

* Fixes for IPCC1996 categorization:

  - category 4.B.10 has the correct title "Anaerobic Lagoons"
  - correct usage of units in the titles of categories 4.C.3.a and 4.C.3.b
